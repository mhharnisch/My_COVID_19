# My_COVID_19

Some very basic (!) simulations and empirical analyses of the current COVID-19 developments. 
Empirical analyses are based on the reported COVID-19 cases by John Hopkins University, updated daily and available at the following github: [https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)

Further explanations of the simulation & assumptions follow.
